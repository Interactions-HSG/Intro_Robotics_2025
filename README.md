# Introduction to Robotics
Hi, here you will find the resources you need for the exercises of the Introduction to Robotics course.
## Exercise 1
In this folder you will find a small python program that we will use during class. 
* Clone the repository -- create a python environment -- install opencv and numpy
* Download a yolo pretrained model from [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/yolov4/yolov4.weights) and put them on the same directory as the cloned code
* For mac users with ARM architecture (M1 + chip) you can install open cv in conda with: ``` conda install -c conda-forge opencv```
